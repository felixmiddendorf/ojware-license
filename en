THE OJ-WARE LICENSE
As long as you retain this notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff.
If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can offer to buy
me a beer in return, which I will refuse because I rather have you buy me a
freshly squeezed orange juice.

PS: Organic would be nice.
